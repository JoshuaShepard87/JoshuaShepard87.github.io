  <p>The most basic information you need to know about radon is that it is the second leading cause of lung cancer behind smoking (21,000 deaths in US per year). You canâ€™t see, smell, or taste radon but it is present in many areas throughout the country.
    Radon is a naturally produced radioactive gas rising from the soil. Radon naturally travels from the soil into your home through various entry points. While radon is more of an issue in certain areas of the country than others, elevated radon levels
    have been found in every state.</p>
  <p>If your home has been tested and has high radon levels, you will want to take action. The typical procedure is installing a Radon Mitigation System. This involves redirecting radon gas from where it enters the home and venting it out of the home
    through pipes. While this can be an easy procedure for some houses, it can require construction and big expenses in others. A radon mitigation system lowers radon levels, but does not eliminate this gas. A residual amount of radon will always be
    present in homes. That is why filtration of particulates in the air is very important, whether you have high radon levels or not.</p>
  <p>The Breathe EZ Air Cleaner is an easy and affordable radon filtration device. Not only does it require no construction, it fits directly into your current HVAC system with absolutely no adjustments. Plus the test results simply speak for themselves.</p>
  <p>Understanding the danger of radon is incredibly important. Someone who never smoked once in his or her life could fall victim to lung cancer if exposed to radon over time. It is something that must be taken seriously. The Breathe EZ Air Cleaner has
    effectively lowered radon to safe levels and does everything that a high end, expensive air filter would do on top of that. With no need for construction and a quick installation, the Breathe EZ is a fast and affordable method to filter radon particulates.</p>
  <p>If you have high radon levels, install a Radon Mitigation System, AND a Breathe EZ Air Cleaner. Protect yourself and your loved ones from this dangerous gas today!!</p>
