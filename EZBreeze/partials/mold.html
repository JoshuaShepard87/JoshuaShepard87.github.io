    <h2>Mold Spores </h2>
  </header>
  <p>These are micro-organisms such as mold and fungal spores that float around in the home and cause serious health effects.</p>
  <p>
    They will always have naturally occurring mold. It’s everywhere. But when mold is in abundance in areas it shouldn’t be, it can reach toxic levels and become a health hazard. Most elevated levels of mold are due to two things—inadequate ventilation in
    unfinished areas of the home and moisture intrusion. Beyond that, their HVAC system when it is running is a natural breeding ground for these microbes. In your furnace you have an A/C coil that is constantly sweating and creating moisture that ends
    up standing in what’s called your drain pan. This standing water in a damp dark environment turns into what I call a “high school science project.” When the blower kicks on it picks these spores and viruses and blows them into ductwork and then
    ultimately into homes for families to breathe in and ingest.</p>
  <p>
    High humidity in a home can create ideal living conditions for these microscopic organisms to live. Standing water or water vapor that seeps in under your foundation can also be a breeding ground for mold growth.</p>
  <p>
    Allergies can also be the direct result of exposure to invisible mold spores. In fact, the Mayo Clinic has now stated that 9 out of 10 sinus infections are now caused by mold instead of bacterial infections, which means that antibiotics are completely
    useless against them. “If you are suffering from any of these health issues or are just plain concerned about the healthiness of your family’s living environment, a simple mold test is always a good idea.” Because the Breathe EZ Air Cleaner filters
    down to .007 microns, it filters mold spores!</p>
