					                    <h1></h1>CREATE A HEALTHY HOME ENVIRONMENT
					                    <p>Feeling good in your home starts with clean, healthy air. Having healthy air means that things like allergies and headaches are less likely to happen. Plus clean air means that things such as mold will have a harder time forming within
					                        your home. This prevents you from experiencing even more airborne dangers. Committing to clean air has so many benefits and will keep you and your home feeling and running great.
					                    </p>
					                    <p>Our homes have been designed in a way to save as much energy as possible. This means that they are constructed to keep air in. While this may be good for saving energy, it can also be harmful since it keeps so many airborne chemicals
					                        and particles inside your home. Homes are often built with some materials that let off harmful particles and these energy efficient homes can also hold in moisture, which will lead to mildew and mold in the home.
					                    </p>
					                    <p>Because homes are constructed to keep everything in, it is important for our health to take extra steps to remove the airborne dangers within our homes. This is what makes air filtration systems so beneficial for homeowners. These
					                        filters absorb these harmful dangers as they pass through the house and keep them from ever reaching you. The best part is that they make a difference immediately. Let’s take a look at some benefits of using a Breathe EZ Air Cleaner
					                        in your home to improve air quality.
					                    </p>
					                    <h1>BENEFITS OF THE BREATHE EZ AIR CLEANER</h1>
					                    <p>Air Quality Improve comfort in home Dramatically reduce family illness Sleep soundly in clean air Reduce allergy-induced fatigue, headaches, breathing problems and sleep loss. Home smells better Reduced pet dander and odors Freedom

					                    <h2>Value</h2>
					                    <p>Save hundreds of dollars compared to expensive HEPA air cleaner ($1200 to $2500 plus installation) or Individual Room Units ($500 to $1000 each) Breathe EZ replacement filters are inexpensive (about $100 per year) Energy savings! COST
					                        COMPARISON TO “CLOSE” TECHNOLOGY Breathe EZ Air Cleaner $549 (includes installation and 1 pack/4 replacement filters) Replacement Filter Media $119/year 5 Year Investment= $1025
					                    </p>
