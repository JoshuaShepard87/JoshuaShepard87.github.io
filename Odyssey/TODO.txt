ROUND 2...


Whole page

  x  PROBLEM: When page WIDTH is too small, the background-color changes and I cannot scroll vertically.

  x  TASK: Remove the "Notifications" for now.

The intro paragraph

    x TASK: Left-align

The lessons

    Great options.

  x  1. Use the "Unit 3" example
  x  2. Make it one column
  x  3. Everything on one page (no tabs)
  x  4. Remove all the descriptions, except for one of the lessons.

Lesson "Quiz".

  x  TASK: Please make the choices "checkboxes"
  x  TASK: Please rename "Submit" to "Submit answer".

Student Accounts

  x  TASK: Please add in three elements at the top, for "status, success, warning, error" (however Bootstrap names them).

x    TASK: Here are the columns: ID, NAME STATUS
x    TASK: The "Name" and "Status" columns:

x            a. Will be underlined.
x            b. Will show a dialog or balloon when deliberately "clicked" (with close [x]).






Best wishes,
Biagio
